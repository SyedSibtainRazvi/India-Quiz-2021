# India Quiz

## Description:
This is an amazing **CLI India Quiz** application that I have build. It has a series of **question** and you are awarded 1 point for every right answer and **final score** displayed at the end of the game.

### Technologies Used:
1) JavaScript (Node JS).
2) Replit.
3) *readLineSync* [npm readlineSync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync)
4) [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)

**Brief:** In this project, I have used an **readlineSync module** to read the input from the user, and then an **object** of questions and answers. To check the answers, I have put **If/Else conditions** and finally **for loop** to keep moving to next questions. For score, I have set a global variable that gets incremented. To beautify it, I have used **Chalk module**

#### What Next?
Add levels and phases in the Quiz.

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features in the application._
